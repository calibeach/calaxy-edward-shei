Thank you to the Calaxy team!

To summarize, I completed the following tasks:

1.  Created a form where users can input data to create an invoice
2.  Linked the contents of the form to a backend using JSON Server (results can be seen in the db.json file)
3.  Results of the form are displayed on a table to the right of the form
4.  Created a unit tests for the project using Vitest
5.  Created an isLate column, with a tooltip which appears onHover, which dynamically determines if the invoice is late or not

What I would do if I had more time

1.  Create additional tests for the project
2.  Create error handling if user types wrong data in an input field (i.e. non-numbers into the purchase price field)

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```
