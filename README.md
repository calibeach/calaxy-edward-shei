Thank you to the Polly Team for such a fun take home!

To summarize, I completed the following tasks:

1.  Created a sortable table, and when the user clicks on a column head, the table data will be organized by the data in that row appearing in an ascending or descending manner.
2.  Created the requested input fields for the user to input data to received calculated mortgage information
3.  Calculated mortgage details will be rendered to the screen after the generate rates button is pressed

What I would do if I had more time

1.  Create end to end tests to ensure that the correct data is being rendered to the screen after a user enters data
2.  Disable the Down Payment in % field if the user types in data into the Down Payment is $ field, and vice-versa
3.  Create error handling if user types wrong data in an input field (i.e.  non-numbers into the purchase price field)
